## Resources


### Operation

Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

**Operations**: ✅ Create ✅ Read ✅ Delete

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | String | ✅ | The name of the operation resource to be cancelled. |


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |
| `done` | bool | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |
| `response` | HashMap<String, String> | The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create operation
operation = provider.gameservices_api.Operation {
    name = "value"  # The name of the operation resource to be cancelled.
}

# Access operation outputs
operation_id = operation.id
operation_metadata = operation.metadata
operation_done = operation.done
operation_error = operation.error
operation_name = operation.name
operation_response = operation.response
```

### Game_server_deployment

Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error. Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may "fail open" without warning.

**Operations**: ✅ Create ✅ Read

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `permissions` | Vec<String> |  | The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with wildcards (such as `*` or `storage.*`) are not allowed. For more information see [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions). |
| `resource` | String | ✅ | REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. |


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `rules` | Vec<String> | If more than one rule is specified, the rules are applied in the following manner: - All matching LOG rules are always applied. - If any DENY/DENY_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is denied. Logging will be applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. - Otherwise, if any ALLOW/ALLOW_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is granted. Logging will be applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. - Otherwise, if no rule applies, permission is denied. |
| `version` | i64 | Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). |
| `audit_configs` | Vec<String> | Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy. |
| `etag` | String | `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. |
| `bindings` | Vec<String> | Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`. Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create game_server_deployment
game_server_deployment = provider.gameservices_api.Game_server_deployment {
    resource = "value"  # REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field.
}

# Access game_server_deployment outputs
game_server_deployment_id = game_server_deployment.id
game_server_deployment_rules = game_server_deployment.rules
game_server_deployment_version = game_server_deployment.version
game_server_deployment_audit_configs = game_server_deployment.audit_configs
game_server_deployment_etag = game_server_deployment.etag
game_server_deployment_bindings = game_server_deployment.bindings
```

### Location

Gets information about a location.

**Operations**: ✅ Read

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `labels` | HashMap<String, String> | Cross-service attributes for the location. For example {"cloud.googleapis.com/region": "us-east1"} |
| `display_name` | String | The friendly name for this location, typically a nearby city name. For example, "Tokyo". |
| `location_id` | String | The canonical id for this location. For example: `"us-east1"`. |
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata. For example the available capacity at the given location. |
| `name` | String | Resource name for the location, which may vary between implementations. For example: `"projects/example-project/locations/us-east1"` |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Access location outputs
location_id = location.id
location_labels = location.labels
location_display_name = location.display_name
location_location_id = location.location_id
location_metadata = location.metadata
location_name = location.name
```

## Common Operations

### Creating Multiple Resources

```kcl
import gcp

provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create multiple operation resources
operation_0 = provider.gameservices_api.Operation {
    name = "value-0"
}
operation_1 = provider.gameservices_api.Operation {
    name = "value-1"
}
operation_2 = provider.gameservices_api.Operation {
    name = "value-2"
}
```

### Conditional Creation

```kcl
# Only create in production
if environment == "production":
    operation = provider.gameservices_api.Operation {
        name = "production-value"
    }
```
