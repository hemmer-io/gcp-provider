## Resources


### Customer

Orders a new customer's account. Before ordering a new customer account, establish whether the customer account already exists using the [`customers.get`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/admin/reseller/v1/reference/customers/get) If the customer account exists as a direct Google account or as a resold customer account from another reseller, use the `customerAuthToken\` as described in [order a resold account for an existing customer](https://developers.google.com/workspace/admin/reseller/v1/how-tos/manage_customers#create_existing_customer). For more information about ordering a new customer account, see [order a new customer account](https://developers.google.com/workspace/admin/reseller/v1/how-tos/manage_customers#create_customer). After creating a new customer account, you must provision a user as an administrator. The customer's administrator is required to sign in to the Admin console and sign the G Suite via Reseller agreement to activate the account. Resellers are prohibited from signing the G Suite via Reseller agreement on the customer's behalf. For more information, see [order a new customer account](https://developers.google.com/workspace/admin/reseller/v1/how-tos/manage_customers#tos).

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `primary_admin` | String |  | The first admin details of the customer, present in case of TEAM customer. |
| `alternate_email` | String |  | Like the "Customer email" in the reseller tools, this email is the secondary contact used if something happens to the customer's service such as service outage or a security issue. This property is required when creating a new "domain" customer and should not use the same domain as `customerDomain`. The `alternateEmail` field is not necessary to create a "team" customer. |
| `postal_address` | String |  | A customer's address information. Each field has a limit of 255 charcters. |

| `phone_number` | String |  | Customer contact phone number. Must start with "+" followed by the country code. The rest of the number can be contiguous numbers or respect the phone local format conventions, but it must be a real phone number and not, for example, "123". This field is silently ignored if invalid. |
| `customer_type` | String |  | Identifies the type of the customer. Acceptable values include: * `domain`: Implies a domain-verified customer (default). * `team`: Implies an email-verified customer. For more information, see [managed teams](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9939479). |
| `customer_id` | String |  | This property will always be returned in a response as the unique identifier generated by Google. In a request, this property can be either the primary domain or the unique identifier generated by Google. |
| `resource_ui_url` | String |  | URL to customer's Admin console dashboard. The read-only URL is generated by the API service. This is used if your client application requires the customer to complete a task in the Admin console. |

### Subscription

Creates or transfer a subscription. Create a subscription for a customer's account that you ordered using the [Order a new customer account](https://developers.google.com/workspace/admin/reseller/v1/reference/customers/insert.html) method. For more information about creating a subscription for different payment plans, see [manage subscriptions](https://developers.google.com/workspace/admin/reseller/v1/how-tos/manage_subscriptions#create_subscription).\ If you did not order the customer's account using the customer insert method, use the customer's `customerAuthToken` when creating a subscription for that customer. If transferring a G Suite subscription with an associated Google Drive or Google Vault subscription, use the [batch operation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/admin/reseller/v1/how-tos/batch.html) to transfer all of these subscriptions. For more information, see how to [transfer subscriptions](https://developers.google.com/workspace/admin/reseller/v1/how-tos/manage_subscriptions#transfer_a_subscription).
