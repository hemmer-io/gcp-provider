### Finalized_deal

Sets the given finalized deal as ready to serve. By default, deals are set as ready to serve as soon as they're finalized. If you want to opt out of the default behavior, and manually indicate that deals are ready to serve, ask your Technical Account Manager to add you to the allowlist. If you choose to use this method, finalized deals belonging to the bidder and its child seats don't start serving until after you call `setReadyToServe`, and after the deals become active. For example, you can use this method to delay receiving bid requests until your creative is ready. In addition, bidders can use the URL path "/v1alpha/bidders/{accountId}/finalizedDeals/{dealId}" to set ready to serve for the finalized deals belong to itself, its child seats and all their clients. This method only applies to programmatic guaranteed deals.

## Common Operations

### Creating Multiple Resources

```kcl
import gcp

provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create multiple deal resources
deal_0 = provider.authorizedbuyersmarketplace_api.Deal {
    parent = "value-0"
}
deal_1 = provider.authorizedbuyersmarketplace_api.Deal {
    parent = "value-1"
}
deal_2 = provider.authorizedbuyersmarketplace_api.Deal {
    parent = "value-2"
}
```

### Conditional Creation

```kcl
# Only create in production
if environment == "production":
    deal = provider.authorizedbuyersmarketplace_api.Deal {
        parent = "production-value"
    }
```
