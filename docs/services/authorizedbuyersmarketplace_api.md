## Common Operations

### Creating Multiple Resources

```kcl
import gcp

provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create multiple deal resources
deal_0 = provider.authorizedbuyersmarketplace_api.Deal {
    parent = "value-0"
}
deal_1 = provider.authorizedbuyersmarketplace_api.Deal {
    parent = "value-1"
}
deal_2 = provider.authorizedbuyersmarketplace_api.Deal {
    parent = "value-2"
}
```

### Conditional Creation

```kcl
# Only create in production
if environment == "production":
    deal = provider.authorizedbuyersmarketplace_api.Deal {
        parent = "production-value"
    }
```
