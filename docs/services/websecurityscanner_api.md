| `result_state` | String | The result state of the ScanRun. This field is only available after the execution state reaches "FINISHED". |
| `error_trace` | String | If result_state is an ERROR, this field provides the primary reason for scan's termination and more details, if such are available. |
| `name` | String | The resource name of the ScanRun. The name follows the format of 'projects/{projectId}/scanConfigs/{scanConfigId}/scanRuns/{scanRunId}'. The ScanRun IDs are generated by the system. |
| `warning_traces` | Vec<String> | A list of warnings, if such are encountered during this scan run. |

## Common Operations

### Creating Multiple Resources

```kcl
import gcp

provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create multiple finding resources
finding_0 = provider.websecurityscanner_api.Finding {
}
finding_1 = provider.websecurityscanner_api.Finding {
}
finding_2 = provider.websecurityscanner_api.Finding {
}
```

### Conditional Creation

```kcl
# Only create in production
if environment == "production":
    finding = provider.websecurityscanner_api.Finding {
    }
```
