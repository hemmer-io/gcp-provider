### Operation

Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

**Operations**: ✅ Create ✅ Read ✅ Delete

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | String | ✅ | The name of the operation resource to be cancelled. |


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |
| `response` | HashMap<String, String> | The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |
| `done` | bool | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create operation
operation = provider.beyondcorp_api.Operation {
    name = "value"  # The name of the operation resource to be cancelled.
}

# Access operation outputs
operation_id = operation.id
operation_error = operation.error
operation_metadata = operation.metadata
operation_response = operation.response
operation_name = operation.name
operation_done = operation.done

### Application_domain

Sets the access control policy on the specified resource. Replaces any existing policy. Can return `NOT_FOUND`, `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, and `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors.

**Operations**: ✅ Create ✅ Read

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `update_mask` | String |  | OPTIONAL: A FieldMask specifying which fields of the policy to modify. Only the fields in the mask will be modified. If no mask is provided, the following default mask is used: `paths: "bindings, etag"` |
| `policy` | String |  | REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the `resource`. The size of the policy is limited to a few 10s of KB. An empty policy is a valid policy but certain Google Cloud services (such as Projects) might reject them. |
| `resource` | String | ✅ | REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. |


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `etag` | String | `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. |
| `bindings` | Vec<String> | Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`. Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`. |
| `version` | i64 | Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). |
| `audit_configs` | Vec<String> | Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create application_domain
application_domain = provider.beyondcorp_api.Application_domain {
    resource = "value"  # REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field.
}

# Access application_domain outputs
application_domain_id = application_domain.id
application_domain_etag = application_domain.etag
application_domain_bindings = application_domain.bindings
application_domain_version = application_domain.version

### Operation

Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

**Operations**: ✅ Create ✅ Read ✅ Delete

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | String | ✅ | The name of the operation resource to be cancelled. |


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `done` | bool | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |
| `response` | HashMap<String, String> | The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create operation
operation = provider.beyondcorp_api.Operation {
    name = "value"  # The name of the operation resource to be cancelled.
}

# Access operation outputs
operation_id = operation.id
operation_done = operation.done
operation_metadata = operation.metadata
operation_response = operation.response
operation_name = operation.name
operation_error = operation.error
```

#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create connector
connector = provider.beyondcorp_api.Connector {
    parent = "value"  # Required. The resource project name of the connector location using the form: `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}`
}

# Access connector outputs
connector_id = connector.id
connector_display_name = connector.display_name
connector_principal_info = connector.principal_info
connector_labels = connector.labels
connector_update_time = connector.update_time
connector_create_time = connector.create_time
connector_name = connector.name
connector_uid = connector.uid
connector_state = connector.state
connector_resource_info = connector.resource_info
```

## Common Operations

### Creating Multiple Resources

```kcl
import gcp

provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create multiple app_connector resources
app_connector_0 = provider.beyondcorp_api.App_connector {
    parent = "value-0"
}
app_connector_1 = provider.beyondcorp_api.App_connector {
    parent = "value-1"
}
app_connector_2 = provider.beyondcorp_api.App_connector {
    parent = "value-2"
}
```

### Conditional Creation

```kcl
# Only create in production
if environment == "production":
    app_connector = provider.beyondcorp_api.App_connector {
        parent = "production-value"
    }
```
