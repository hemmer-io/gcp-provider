## Resources


### Verification_token

Generate a token for the provided location data to verify the location.

**Operations**: ✅ Create

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `location_id` | String |  | The location identifier associated with an unverified listing. This is the location id generated at the time that the listing was originally created. It is the final portion of a location resource name as generated by the Google My Business API. Note: the caller must be an owner or manager of this listing in order to generate a verification token. See the [location resource](/my-business/reference/rest/v4/accounts.locations) documentation for more information. |
| `location_data` | String |  | Immutable. The address and other details of the location to generate an instant verification token for. |



#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create verification_token
verification_token = provider.mybusinessverifications_api.Verification_token {
}

```

### Location

Reports all eligible verification options for a location in a specific language.

**Operations**: ✅ Create ✅ Read

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `language_code` | String |  | Required. The BCP 47 language code representing the language that is to be used for the verification process. Available options vary by language. |
| `context` | String |  | Optional. Extra context information for the verification of service businesses. Can only be applied to the locations whose business type is CUSTOMER_LOCATION_ONLY. Specifying an accurate address could enable more options. INVALID_ARGUMENT will be thrown if it is set for other business types of locations. |
| `location` | String | ✅ | Required. The location to verify. |


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `comply_with_guidelines` | String | The location fails to comply with our [guidelines](https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038177) and requires additional steps for reinstatement. To fix this issue, consult the [Help Center Article](https://support.google.com/business/answer/4569145). |
| `verify` | String | Start or continue the verification process. |
| `wait_for_voice_of_merchant` | String | Wait to gain Voice of Merchant. The location is under review for quality purposes. |
| `resolve_ownership_conflict` | String | This location duplicates another location that is in good standing. If you have access to the location in good standing, use that location's id to perform operations. Otherwise, request access from the current owner. |
| `has_business_authority` | bool | Indicates whether the location has the authority (ownership) over the business on Google. If true, another location cannot take over and become the dominant listing on Maps. However, edits will not become live unless Voice of Merchant is gained (i.e. has_voice_of_merchant is true). |
| `has_voice_of_merchant` | bool | Indicates whether the location is in good standing and has control over the business on Google. Any edits made to the location will propagate to Maps after passing the review phase. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create location
location = provider.mybusinessverifications_api.Location {
    location = "value"  # Required. The location to verify.
}

# Access location outputs
location_id = location.id
location_comply_with_guidelines = location.comply_with_guidelines
location_verify = location.verify
location_wait_for_voice_of_merchant = location.wait_for_voice_of_merchant
location_resolve_ownership_conflict = location.resolve_ownership_conflict
location_has_business_authority = location.has_business_authority
location_has_voice_of_merchant = location.has_voice_of_merchant
```

### Verification

Completes a `PENDING` verification. It is only necessary for non `AUTO` verification methods. `AUTO` verification request is instantly `VERIFIED` upon creation.

**Operations**: ✅ Create ✅ Read

| `verifications` | Vec<String> | List of the verifications. |
| `next_page_token` | String | If the number of verifications exceeded the requested page size, this field will be populated with a token to fetch the next page of verification on a subsequent call. If there are no more attributes, this field will not be present in the response. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create verification
verification = provider.mybusinessverifications_api.Verification {
    name = "value"  # Required. Resource name of the verification to complete.
}

# Access verification outputs
verification_id = verification.id
verification_verifications = verification.verifications
verification_next_page_token = verification.next_page_token
```

## Common Operations

### Creating Multiple Resources

```kcl
import gcp

provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create multiple verification_token resources
verification_token_0 = provider.mybusinessverifications_api.Verification_token {
}
verification_token_1 = provider.mybusinessverifications_api.Verification_token {
}
verification_token_2 = provider.mybusinessverifications_api.Verification_token {
}
```

### Conditional Creation

```kcl
# Only create in production
if environment == "production":
    verification_token = provider.mybusinessverifications_api.Verification_token {
    }
```
