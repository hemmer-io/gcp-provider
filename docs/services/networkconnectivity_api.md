### Operation

Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

**Operations**: ✅ Create ✅ Read ✅ Delete

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | String | ✅ | The name of the operation resource to be cancelled. |


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |
| `done` | bool | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
| `response` | HashMap<String, String> | The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create operation
operation = provider.networkconnectivity_api.Operation {
    name = "value"  # The name of the operation resource to be cancelled.
}

# Access operation outputs
operation_id = operation.id
operation_name = operation.name
operation_done = operation.done
operation_response = operation.response
operation_metadata = operation.metadata
operation_error = operation.error
```

### Location

CheckConsumerConfig validates the consumer network and project for potential PSC connection creation. This method performs several checks, including: - Validating the existence and permissions of the service class. - Ensuring the consumer network exists and is accessible. - Verifying XPN relationships if applicable. - Checking for compatible IP versions between the consumer network and the requested version. This method performs a dynamic IAM check for the `networkconnectivity.serviceClasses.use` permission on the service class resource in the Prepare phase.

### Internal_range

Creates a new internal range in a given project and location.

**Operations**: ✅ Create ✅ Read ✅ Update ✅ Delete

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `users` | Vec<String> |  | Output only. The list of resources that refer to this internal range. Resources that use the internal range for their range allocation are referred to as users of the range. Other resources mark themselves as users while doing so by creating a reference to this internal range. Having a user, based on this reference, prevents deletion of the internal range referred to. Can be empty. |
| `labels` | HashMap<String, String> |  | User-defined labels. |
| `name` | String |  | Identifier. The name of an internal range. Format: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/internalRanges/{internal_range} See: https://google.aip.dev/122#fields-representing-resource-names |
| `peering` | String |  | Optional. The type of peering set for this internal range. |
| `create_time` | String |  | Time when the internal range was created. |
| `network` | String |  | Immutable. The URL or resource ID of the network in which to reserve the internal range. The network cannot be deleted if there are any reserved internal ranges referring to it. Legacy networks are not supported. For example: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/locations/global/networks/{network} projects/{project}/locations/global/networks/{network} {network} |
| `immutable` | bool |  | Optional. Immutable ranges cannot have their fields modified, except for labels and description. |
| `migration` | String |  | Optional. Must be present if usage is set to FOR_MIGRATION. |
| `description` | String |  | Optional. A description of this resource. |
| `overlaps` | Vec<String> |  | Optional. Types of resources that are allowed to overlap with the current internal range. |
| `update_time` | String |  | Time when the internal range was updated. |
| `ip_cidr_range` | String |  | Optional. The IP range that this internal range defines. NOTE: IPv6 ranges are limited to usage=EXTERNAL_TO_VPC and peering=FOR_SELF. NOTE: For IPv6 Ranges this field is compulsory, i.e. the address range must be specified explicitly. |
| `target_cidr_range` | Vec<String> |  | Optional. Can be set to narrow down or pick a different address space while searching for a free range. If not set, defaults to the ["10.0.0.0/8", "172.16.0.0/12", "192.168.0.0/16"] address space (for auto-mode networks, the "10.0.0.0/9" range is used instead of "10.0.0.0/8"). This can be used to target the search in other rfc-1918 address spaces like "172.16.0.0/12" and "192.168.0.0/16" or non-rfc-1918 address spaces used in the VPC. |
| `allocation_options` | String |  | Optional. Range auto-allocation options, may be set only when auto-allocation is selected by not setting ip_cidr_range (and setting prefix_length). |
| `exclude_cidr_ranges` | Vec<String> |  | Optional. ExcludeCidrRanges flag. Specifies a set of CIDR blocks that allows exclusion of particular CIDR ranges from the auto-allocation process, without having to reserve these blocks |
| `prefix_length` | i64 |  | Optional. An alternate to ip_cidr_range. Can be set when trying to create an IPv4 reservation that automatically finds a free range of the given size. If both ip_cidr_range and prefix_length are set, there is an error if the range sizes do not match. Can also be used during updates to change the range size. NOTE: For IPv6 this field only works if ip_cidr_range is set as well, and both fields must match. In other words, with IPv6 this field only works as a redundant parameter. |
| `usage` | String |  | Optional. The type of usage set for this InternalRange. |
| `parent` | String | ✅ | Required. The parent resource's name of the internal range. |

### Operation

Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

**Operations**: ✅ Create ✅ Read ✅ Delete

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | String | ✅ | The name of the operation resource to be cancelled. |


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `response` | HashMap<String, String> | The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |
| `done` | bool | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create operation
operation = provider.networkconnectivity_api.Operation {
    name = "value"  # The name of the operation resource to be cancelled.
}

# Access operation outputs
operation_id = operation.id
operation_response = operation.response
operation_error = operation.error
operation_metadata = operation.metadata
operation_done = operation.done
operation_name = operation.name
```

Legacy networks are not supported. For example: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/locations/global/networks/{network} projects/{project}/locations/global/networks/{network} {network} |
| `ip_cidr_range` | String |  | IP range that this internal range defines. NOTE: IPv6 ranges are limited to usage=EXTERNAL_TO_VPC and peering=FOR_SELF. NOTE: For IPv6 Ranges this field is compulsory, i.e. the address range must be specified explicitly. |
| `overlaps` | Vec<String> |  | Optional. Types of resources that are allowed to overlap with the current internal range. |
| `allocation_options` | String |  | Optional. Range auto-allocation options, may be set only when auto-allocation is selected by not setting ip_cidr_range (and setting prefix_length). |
| `prefix_length` | i64 |  | An alternative to ip_cidr_range. Can be set when trying to create an IPv4 reservation that automatically finds a free range of the given size. If both ip_cidr_range and prefix_length are set, there is an error if the range sizes do not match. Can also be used during updates to change the range size.

| `target_cidr_range` | Vec<String> |  | Optional. Can be set to narrow down or pick a different address space while searching for a free range. If not set, defaults to the ["10.0.0.0/8", "172.16.0.0/12", "192.168.0.0/16"] address space (for auto-mode networks, the "10.0.0.0/9" range is used instead of "10.0.0.0/8"). This can be used to target the search in other rfc-1918 address spaces like "172.16.0.0/12" and "192.168.0.0/16" or non-rfc-1918 address spaces used in the VPC. |
| `users` | Vec<String> |  | Output only. The list of resources that refer to this internal range. Resources that use the internal range for their range allocation are referred to as users of the range. Other resources mark themselves as users while doing so by creating a reference to this internal range. Having a user, based on this reference, prevents deletion of the internal range that is referred to. Can be empty. |
| `exclude_cidr_ranges` | Vec<String> |  | Optional. ExcludeCidrRanges flag. Specifies a set of CIDR blocks that allows exclusion of particular CIDR ranges from the auto-allocation process, without having to reserve these blocks |
| `immutable` | bool |  | Optional. Immutable ranges cannot have their fields modified, except for labels and description. |
| `peering` | String |  | The type of peering set for this internal range. |
| `update_time` | String |  | Time when the internal range was updated. |

# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Access location outputs
location_id = location.id
location_location_id = location.location_id
location_display_name = location.display_name
location_metadata = location.metadata
location_name = location.name
location_labels = location.labels
```

## Common Operations

### Creating Multiple Resources

```kcl
import gcp

provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create multiple multicloud_data_transfer_supported_service resources
multicloud_data_transfer_supported_service_0 = provider.networkconnectivity_api.Multicloud_data_transfer_supported_service {
}
multicloud_data_transfer_supported_service_1 = provider.networkconnectivity_api.Multicloud_data_transfer_supported_service {
}
multicloud_data_transfer_supported_service_2 = provider.networkconnectivity_api.Multicloud_data_transfer_supported_service {
}
```

### Conditional Creation

```kcl
# Only create in production
if environment == "production":
    multicloud_data_transfer_supported_service = provider.networkconnectivity_api.Multicloud_data_transfer_supported_service {
    }
```
