### Operation

Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

**Operations**: ✅ Create ✅ Read ✅ Delete

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | String | ✅ | The name of the operation resource to be cancelled. |


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |
| `response` | HashMap<String, String> | The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |
| `done` | bool | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create operation
operation = provider.securesourcemanager_api.Operation {
    name = "value"  # The name of the operation resource to be cancelled.
}

# Access operation outputs
operation_id = operation.id
operation_name = operation.name
operation_response = operation.response
operation_done = operation.done
operation_error = operation.error
operation_metadata = operation.metadata
```

| `create_time` | String | Output only. Create timestamp. |
| `events` | Vec<String> | Optional. The events that trigger hook on. |
| `update_time` | String | Output only. Update timestamp. |
| `disabled` | bool | Optional. Determines if the hook disabled or not. Set to true to stop sending traffic. |

#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create hook
hook = provider.securesourcemanager_api.Hook {
    parent = "value"  # Required. The repository in which to create the hook. Values are of the form `projects/{project_number}/locations/{location_id}/repositories/{repository_id}`
}

# Access hook outputs
hook_id = hook.id
hook_name = hook.name
hook_create_time = hook.create_time
hook_events = hook.events
hook_update_time = hook.update_time
hook_disabled = hook.disabled
hook_sensitive_query_string = hook.sensitive_query_string
hook_push_option = hook.push_option
hook_target_uri = hook.target_uri
hook_uid = hook.uid
```

## Common Operations

### Creating Multiple Resources

```kcl
import gcp

provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create multiple instance resources
instance_0 = provider.securesourcemanager_api.Instance {
    parent = "value-0"
}
instance_1 = provider.securesourcemanager_api.Instance {
    parent = "value-1"
}
instance_2 = provider.securesourcemanager_api.Instance {
    parent = "value-2"
}
```

### Conditional Creation

```kcl
# Only create in production
if environment == "production":
    instance = provider.securesourcemanager_api.Instance {
        parent = "production-value"
    }
```
