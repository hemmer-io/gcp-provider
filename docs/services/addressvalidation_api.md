### Addressvalidation

Validates an address.

**Operations**: ✅ Create

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `session_token` | String |  | Optional. A string which identifies an Autocomplete session for billing purposes. Must be a URL and filename safe base64 string with at most 36 ASCII characters in length. Otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. The session begins when the user makes an Autocomplete query, and concludes when they select a place and a call to Place Details or Address Validation is made. Each session can have multiple Autocomplete queries, followed by one Place Details or Address Validation request. The credentials used for each request within a session must belong to the same Google Cloud Console project. Once a session has concluded, the token is no longer valid; your app must generate a fresh token for each session. If the `sessionToken` parameter is omitted, or if you reuse a session token, the session is charged as if no session token was provided (each request is billed separately). Note: Address Validation can only be used in sessions with the Autocomplete (New) API, not the Autocomplete API. See https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/session-pricing for more details. |
| `address` | String |  | Required. The address being validated. Unformatted addresses should be submitted via `address_lines`. The total length of the fields in this input must not exceed 280 characters. Supported regions can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/address-validation/coverage). The language_code value in the input address is reserved for future uses and is ignored today. The validated address result will be populated based on the preferred language for the given address, as identified by the system. The Address Validation API ignores the values in recipients and organization. Any values in those fields will be discarded and not returned. Please do not set them. |
| `enable_usps_cass` | bool |  | Enables USPS CASS compatible mode. This affects _only_ the [google.maps.addressvalidation.v1.ValidationResult.usps_data] field of [google.maps.addressvalidation.v1.ValidationResult]. Note: for USPS CASS enabled requests for addresses in Puerto Rico, a [google.type.PostalAddress.region_code] of the `address` must be provided as "PR", or an [google.type.PostalAddress.administrative_area] of the `address` must be provided as "Puerto Rico" (case-insensitive) or "PR". It's recommended to use a componentized `address`, or alternatively specify at least two [google.type.PostalAddress.address_lines] where the first line contains the street number and name and the second line contains the city, state, and zip code. |
| `language_options` | String |  | Optional. Preview: This feature is in Preview (pre-GA). Pre-GA products and features might have limited support, and changes to pre-GA products and features might not be compatible with other pre-GA versions. Pre-GA Offerings are covered by the [Google Maps Platform Service Specific Terms](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms/maps-service-terms). For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://developers.google.com/maps/launch-stages). Enables the Address Validation API to include additional information in the response. |
| `previous_response_id` | String |  | This field must be empty for the first address validation request. If more requests are necessary to fully validate a single address (for example if the changes the user makes after the initial validation need to be re-validated), then each followup request must populate this field with the response_id from the very first response in the validation sequence. |



#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create addressvalidation
addressvalidation = provider.addressvalidation_api.Addressvalidation {
}

```

---



## Common Operations

### Creating Multiple Resources

```kcl
import gcp

provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create multiple addressvalidation resources
addressvalidation_0 = provider.addressvalidation_api.Addressvalidation {
}
addressvalidation_1 = provider.addressvalidation_api.Addressvalidation {
}
addressvalidation_2 = provider.addressvalidation_api.Addressvalidation {
}
```

### Conditional Creation

```kcl
# Only create in production
if environment == "production":
    addressvalidation = provider.addressvalidation_api.Addressvalidation {
    }
```
