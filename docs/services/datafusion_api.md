### Operation

Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

**Operations**: ✅ Create ✅ Read ✅ Delete

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | String | ✅ | The name of the operation resource to be cancelled. |


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |
| `done` | bool | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
| `response` | HashMap<String, String> | The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create operation
operation = provider.datafusion_api.Operation {
    name = "value"  # The name of the operation resource to be cancelled.
}

# Access operation outputs
operation_id = operation.id
operation_name = operation.name
operation_metadata = operation.metadata
operation_done = operation.done
operation_response = operation.response
operation_error = operation.error
```

---


### Version

Lists possible versions for Data Fusion instances in the specified project and location.

**Operations**: ✅ Read

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `available_versions` | Vec<String> | Represents a list of versions that are supported. Deprecated: Use versions field instead. |
| `versions` | Vec<String> | Represents a list of all versions. |
| `next_page_token` | String | Token to retrieve the next page of results or empty if there are no more results in the list. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Access version outputs
version_id = version.id

### Namespace

Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error. Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may "fail open" without warning.

**Operations**: ✅ Create ✅ Read

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `permissions` | Vec<String> |  | The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with wildcards (such as `*` or `storage.*`) are not allowed. For more information see [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions). |
| `resource` | String | ✅ | REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. |


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `next_page_token` | String | Token to retrieve the next page of results or empty if there are no more results in the list. |
| `namespaces` | Vec<String> | List of namespaces |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create namespace
namespace = provider.datafusion_api.Namespace {
    resource = "value"  # REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field.
}

# Access namespace outputs
namespace_id = namespace.id
namespace_next_page_token = namespace.next_page_token
namespace_namespaces = namespace.namespaces
```

### Operation

Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

**Operations**: ✅ Create ✅ Read ✅ Delete

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | String | ✅ | The name of the operation resource to be cancelled. |


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |
| `done` | bool | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |
| `response` | HashMap<String, String> | The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create operation
operation = provider.datafusion_api.Operation {
    name = "value"  # The name of the operation resource to be cancelled.
}

# Access operation outputs
operation_id = operation.id
operation_name = operation.name
operation_done = operation.done
operation_error = operation.error
operation_metadata = operation.metadata
operation_response = operation.response
```

### Location

Remove IAM policy that is currently set on the given resource.

**Operations**: ✅ Create ✅ Read

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `resource` | String | ✅ | Required. The resource on which IAM policy to be removed is attached to. |


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `name` | String | Resource name for the location, which may vary between implementations. For example: `"projects/example-project/locations/us-east1"` |
| `display_name` | String | The friendly name for this location, typically a nearby city name. For example, "Tokyo". |
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata. For example the available capacity at the given location. |
| `location_id` | String | The canonical id for this location. For example: `"us-east1"`. |
| `labels` | HashMap<String, String> | Cross-service attributes for the location. For example {"cloud.googleapis.com/region": "us-east1"} |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create location
location = provider.datafusion_api.Location {
    resource = "value"  # Required. The resource on which IAM policy to be removed is attached to.
}

# Access location outputs
location_id = location.id
location_name = location.name
location_display_name = location.display_name
location_metadata = location.metadata
location_location_id = location.location_id
location_labels = location.labels

## Common Operations

### Creating Multiple Resources

```kcl
import gcp

provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create multiple instance resources
instance_0 = provider.datafusion_api.Instance {
    parent = "value-0"
}
instance_1 = provider.datafusion_api.Instance {
    parent = "value-1"
}
instance_2 = provider.datafusion_api.Instance {
    parent = "value-2"
}
```

### Conditional Creation

```kcl
# Only create in production
if environment == "production":
    instance = provider.datafusion_api.Instance {
        parent = "production-value"
    }
```
