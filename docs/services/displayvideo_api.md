### Operation

Gets the latest state of an asynchronous SDF download task operation. Clients should poll this method at intervals of 30 seconds.

**Operations**: ✅ Read

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |
| `done` | bool | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |
| `response` | HashMap<String, String> | The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Access operation outputs
operation_id = operation.id
operation_metadata = operation.metadata
operation_done = operation.done
operation_error = operation.error
operation_name = operation.name
operation_response = operation.response
```

If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |
| `done` | bool | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |

### Operation

Gets the latest state of an asynchronous SDF download task operation. Clients should poll this method at intervals of 30 seconds.

**Operations**: ✅ Read

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |
| `done` | bool | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
| `response` | HashMap<String, String> | The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Access operation outputs
operation_id = operation.id
operation_name = operation.name

### Operation

Gets the latest state of an asynchronous SDF download task operation. Clients should poll this method at intervals of 30 seconds.

**Operations**: ✅ Read

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |
| `done` | bool | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |
| `response` | HashMap<String, String> | The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Access operation outputs
operation_id = operation.id
operation_metadata = operation.metadata
operation_done = operation.done
operation_error = operation.error
operation_name = operation.name

If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |
| `done` | bool | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |

Gets the latest state of an asynchronous SDF download task operation. Clients should poll this method at intervals of 30 seconds.

**Operations**: ✅ Read

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |
| `done` | bool | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |
| `response` | HashMap<String, String> | The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}
