## Resources


### Operation

Gets the latest state of an asynchronous SDF download task operation. Clients should poll this method at intervals of 30 seconds.

**Operations**: ✅ Read

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |
| `response` | HashMap<String, String> | The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |
| `done` | bool | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Access operation outputs
operation_id = operation.id
operation_error = operation.error
operation_response = operation.response
operation_metadata = operation.metadata
operation_done = operation.done
operation_name = operation.name
```

---


### Sdfdownloadtask

Creates an SDF Download Task. Returns an Operation. An SDF Download Task is a long-running, asynchronous operation. The metadata type of this operation is SdfDownloadTaskMetadata. If the request is successful, the response type of the operation is SdfDownloadTask. The response will not include the download files, which must be retrieved with media.download. The state of operation can be retrieved with sdfdownloadtask.operations.get. Any errors can be found in the error.message. Note that error.details is expected to be empty.

**Operations**: ✅ Create

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `inventory_source_filter` | String |  | Filters on Inventory Sources by their IDs. |
| `version` | String |  | Required. The SDF version of the downloaded file. If set to `SDF_VERSION_UNSPECIFIED`, this will default to the version specified by the advertiser or partner identified by `root_id`. An advertiser inherits its SDF version from its partner unless configured otherwise. |
| `partner_id` | String |  | The ID of the partner to download SDF for. |
| `parent_entity_filter` | String |  | Filters on selected file types. The entities in each file are filtered by a chosen set of filter entities. The filter entities must be the same type as, or a parent type of, the selected file types. |
| `advertiser_id` | String |  | The ID of the advertiser to download SDF for. |
| `id_filter` | String |  | Filters on entities by their entity IDs. |



#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create sdfdownloadtask
sdfdownloadtask = provider.displayvideo_api.Sdfdownloadtask {
}

```

If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |

| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |

### Operation

Gets the latest state of an asynchronous SDF download task operation. Clients should poll this method at intervals of 30 seconds.

**Operations**: ✅ Read

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |
| `done` | bool | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
| `response` | HashMap<String, String> | The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Access operation outputs
operation_id = operation.id
operation_metadata = operation.metadata
operation_error = operation.error
operation_name = operation.name
operation_done = operation.done
operation_response = operation.response

### Operation

Gets the latest state of an asynchronous SDF download task operation. Clients should poll this method at intervals of 30 seconds.

**Operations**: ✅ Read

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |
| `response` | HashMap<String, String> | The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |
| `done` | bool | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Access operation outputs
operation_id = operation.id
operation_error = operation.error
operation_name = operation.name
operation_response = operation.response
operation_done = operation.done
operation_metadata = operation.metadata
```

## Common Operations

### Creating Multiple Resources

```kcl
import gcp

provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create multiple operation resources
operation_0 = provider.displayvideo_api.Operation {
}
operation_1 = provider.displayvideo_api.Operation {
}
operation_2 = provider.displayvideo_api.Operation {
}
```

### Conditional Creation

```kcl
# Only create in production
if environment == "production":
    operation = provider.displayvideo_api.Operation {
    }
```
