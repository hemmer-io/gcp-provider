#### Fields

|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `update_time` | String |  | Output only. The timestamp when the resource was last updated. Any change to the resource made by users must refresh this value. Changes to a resource made by the service should refresh this value. |
| `saas` | String |  | Required. Immutable. A reference to the Saas that defines the product (managed service) that the producer wants to manage with SaaS Runtime. Part of the SaaS Runtime common data model. Immutable once set. |
| `annotations` | HashMap<String, String> |  | Optional. Annotations is an unstructured key-value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations |

| `uid` | String |  | Output only. The unique identifier of the resource. UID is unique in the time and space for this resource within the scope of the service. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and must not be changed. UID is used to uniquely identify resources with resource name reuses. This should be a UUID4. |
| `output_variable_mappings` | Vec<String> |  | Optional. List of outputVariables for this unit kind will be passed to this unit's outputVariables. Maximum 100. |
| `dependencies` | Vec<String> |  | Optional. Immutable. List of other unit kinds that this release will depend on. Dependencies will be automatically provisioned if not found. Maximum 10. |

## Common Operations

### Creating Multiple Resources

```kcl
import gcp

provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create multiple unit_kind resources
unit_kind_0 = provider.saasservicemgmt_api.Unit_kind {
    parent = "value-0"
}
unit_kind_1 = provider.saasservicemgmt_api.Unit_kind {
    parent = "value-1"
}
unit_kind_2 = provider.saasservicemgmt_api.Unit_kind {
    parent = "value-2"
}
```

### Conditional Creation

```kcl
# Only create in production
if environment == "production":
    unit_kind = provider.saasservicemgmt_api.Unit_kind {
        parent = "production-value"
    }
```
