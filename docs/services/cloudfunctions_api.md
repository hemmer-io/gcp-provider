### Operation

Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.

**Operations**: ✅ Read

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |
| `done` | bool | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |
| `response` | HashMap<String, String> | The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Access operation outputs
operation_id = operation.id
operation_error = operation.error
operation_done = operation.done
operation_name = operation.name
operation_response = operation.response
operation_metadata = operation.metadata
```

more information on connecting Cloud projects. |
| `max_instances` | i64 | The limit on the maximum number of function instances that may coexist at a
given time. |
| `version_id` | String | Output only. The version identifier of the Cloud Function. Each deployment attempt
results in a new version of a function being created. |
| `status` | String | Output only. Status of the function deployment. |
| `timeout` | String | The function execution timeout. Execution is considered failed and
can be terminated if the function is not completed at the end of the
timeout period. Defaults to 60 seconds. |
| `name` | String | A user-defined name of the function. Function names must be unique
globally and match pattern `projects/*/locations/*/functions/*` |
| `network` | String | The VPC Network that this cloud function can connect to. It can be
either the fully-qualified URI, or the short name of the network resource.
If the short network name is used, the network must belong to the same
project. Otherwise, it must belong to a project within the same
organization. The format of this field is either
`projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}` or `{network}`, where
{project} is a project id where the network is defined, and {network} is
the short name of the network.

This field is mutually exclusive with `vpc_connector` and will be replaced
by it.

See [the VPC documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/vpc) for
more information on connecting Cloud projects. |

## Common Operations

### Creating Multiple Resources

```kcl
import gcp

provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create multiple location resources
location_0 = provider.cloudfunctions_api.Location {
}
location_1 = provider.cloudfunctions_api.Location {
}
location_2 = provider.cloudfunctions_api.Location {
}
```

### Conditional Creation

```kcl
# Only create in production
if environment == "production":
    location = provider.cloudfunctions_api.Location {
    }
```
