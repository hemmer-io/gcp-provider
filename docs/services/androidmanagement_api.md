### Operation

Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to Code.CANCELLED.

**Operations**: ✅ Create ✅ Read

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | String | ✅ | The name of the operation resource to be cancelled. |


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |
| `response` | HashMap<String, String> | The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as Delete, the response is google.protobuf.Empty. If the original method is standard Get/Create/Update, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type XxxResponse, where Xxx is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is TakeSnapshot(), the inferred response type is TakeSnapshotResponse. |
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |
| `done` | bool | If the value is false, it means the operation is still in progress. If true, the operation is completed, and either error or response is available. |
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the name should be a resource name ending with operations/{unique_id}. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create operation
operation = provider.androidmanagement_api.Operation {
    name = "value"  # The name of the operation resource to be cancelled.

If not specified, the default duration is 1 hour. Please note that if requested duration causes the resulting expiration_timestamp to exceed Timestamps.MAX_VALUE (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/java/com/google/protobuf/util/Timestamps.html#MAX_VALUE), then expiration_timestamp is coerced to Timestamps.MAX_VALUE. |
| `additional_data` | String |  | Optional, arbitrary data associated with the enrollment token. This could contain, for example, the ID of an org unit the device is assigned to after enrollment. After a device enrolls with the token, this data will be exposed in the enrollment_token_data field of the Device resource.

## Common Operations

### Creating Multiple Resources

```kcl
import gcp

provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create multiple signup_url resources
signup_url_0 = provider.androidmanagement_api.Signup_url {
}
signup_url_1 = provider.androidmanagement_api.Signup_url {
}
signup_url_2 = provider.androidmanagement_api.Signup_url {
}
```

### Conditional Creation

```kcl
# Only create in production
if environment == "production":
    signup_url = provider.androidmanagement_api.Signup_url {
    }
```
