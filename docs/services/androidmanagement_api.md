### Operation

Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to Code.CANCELLED.

**Operations**: ✅ Create ✅ Read

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | String | ✅ | The name of the operation resource to be cancelled. |


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `done` | bool | If the value is false, it means the operation is still in progress. If true, the operation is completed, and either error or response is available. |
| `response` | HashMap<String, String> | The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as Delete, the response is google.protobuf.Empty. If the original method is standard Get/Create/Update, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type XxxResponse, where Xxx is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is TakeSnapshot(), the inferred response type is TakeSnapshotResponse. |
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the name should be a resource name ending with operations/{unique_id}. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create operation
operation = provider.androidmanagement_api.Operation {
    name = "value"  # The name of the operation resource to be cancelled.
}

# Access operation outputs
operation_id = operation.id
operation_done = operation.done
operation_response = operation.response
operation_error = operation.error
operation_metadata = operation.metadata
operation_name = operation.name
```

**Operations**: ✅ Create

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |

}

# Create signup_url
signup_url = provider.androidmanagement_api.Signup_url {

| `parent_frame_url` | String |  | The URL of the parent frame hosting the iframe with the embedded UI. To prevent XSS, the iframe may not be hosted at other URLs. The URL must use the https scheme. |
| `enabled_features` | Vec<String> |  | The features to enable. Use this if you want to control exactly which feature(s) will be activated; leave empty to allow all features.Restrictions / things to note: - If no features are listed here, all features are enabled — this is the default behavior where you give access to all features to your admins. - This must not contain any FEATURE_UNSPECIFIED values. - Repeated values are ignored  |
| `value` | String |  | The token value which is used in the hosting page to generate the iframe with the embedded UI. This is a read-only field generated by the server. |

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `allow_personal_usage` | String |  | Controls whether personal usage is allowed on a device provisioned with this enrollment token.For company-owned devices: Enabling personal usage allows the user to set up a work profile on the device. Disabling personal usage requires the user provision the device as a fully managed device.For personally-owned devices: Enabling personal usage allows the user to set up a work profile on the device. Disabling personal usage will prevent the device from provisioning. Personal usage cannot be disabled on personally-owned device. |
| `policy_name` | String |  | The name of the policy initially applied to the enrolled device, in the form enterprises/{enterpriseId}/policies/{policyId}. If not specified, the policy_name for the device’s user is applied. If user_name is also not specified, enterprises/{enterpriseId}/policies/default is applied by default. When updating this field, you can specify only the policyId as long as the policyId doesn’t contain any slashes. The rest of the policy name will be inferred. |
| `user` | String |  | This field is deprecated and the value is ignored. |
| `duration` | String |  | The length of time the enrollment token is valid, ranging from 1 minute to Durations.MAX_VALUE (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/java/com/google/protobuf/util/Durations.html#MAX_VALUE), approximately 10,000 years. If not specified, the default duration is 1 hour. Please note that if requested duration causes the resulting expiration_timestamp to exceed Timestamps.MAX_VALUE (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/java/com/google/protobuf/util/Timestamps.html#MAX_VALUE), then expiration_timestamp is coerced to Timestamps.MAX_VALUE. |

The data must be 1024 characters or less; otherwise, the creation request will fail. |
| `qr_code` | String |  | A JSON string whose UTF-8 representation can be used to generate a QR code to enroll a device with this enrollment token. To enroll a device using NFC, the NFC record must contain a serialized java.util.Properties representation of the properties in the JSON. |

## Common Operations

### Creating Multiple Resources

```kcl
import gcp

provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create multiple enterprise resources
enterprise_0 = provider.androidmanagement_api.Enterprise {
}
enterprise_1 = provider.androidmanagement_api.Enterprise {
}
enterprise_2 = provider.androidmanagement_api.Enterprise {
}
```

### Conditional Creation

```kcl
# Only create in production
if environment == "production":
    enterprise = provider.androidmanagement_api.Enterprise {
    }
```
