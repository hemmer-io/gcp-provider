### Creating Multiple Resources

```kcl
import gcp

provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create multiple external_account_key resources
external_account_key_0 = provider.publicca_api.External_account_key {
    parent = "value-0"
}
external_account_key_1 = provider.publicca_api.External_account_key {
    parent = "value-1"
}
external_account_key_2 = provider.publicca_api.External_account_key {
    parent = "value-2"
}
```

### Conditional Creation

```kcl
# Only create in production
if environment == "production":
    external_account_key = provider.publicca_api.External_account_key {
        parent = "production-value"
    }
