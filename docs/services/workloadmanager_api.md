## Resources


### Execution

Creates a new Execution in a given project and location.

**Operations**: ✅ Create ✅ Read ✅ Delete

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `execution` | String |  | Required. The resource being created |
| `execution_id` | String |  | Required. Id of the requesting object If auto-generating Id server-side, remove this field and execution_id from the method_signature of Create RPC |
| `request_id` | String |  | Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

### Rule

Lists rules in a given project.

**Operations**: ✅ Read

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `invalid_rules_wrapper` | String | A wrapper of the invalid rules that failed to be validated. |
| `rules` | Vec<String> | all rules in response |


#### Usage Example

---


### Operation

Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

**Operations**: ✅ Create ✅ Read ✅ Delete

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | String | ✅ | The name of the operation resource to be cancelled. |


#### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `metadata` | HashMap<String, String> | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |
| `done` | bool | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
| `error` | String | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |
| `name` | String | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |
| `response` | HashMap<String, String> | The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |


#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create operation
operation = provider.workloadmanager_api.Operation {
    name = "value"  # The name of the operation resource to be cancelled.
}

# Access operation outputs
operation_id = operation.id
operation_metadata = operation.metadata
operation_done = operation.done
operation_error = operation.error
operation_name = operation.name
operation_response = operation.response
```

### Insight

Write the data insights to workload manager data warehouse.

**Operations**: ✅ Create ✅ Delete

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `request_id` | String |  | Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `agent_version` | String |  | Optional. The agent version collected this data point. |
| `insight` | String |  | Required. The metrics data details. |
| `location` | String | ✅ | Required. The GCP location. The format is: projects/{project}/locations/{location}. |



#### Usage Example

```kcl
# main.k
import gcp

# Initialize provider
provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create insight
insight = provider.workloadmanager_api.Insight {
    location = "value"  # Required. The GCP location. The format is: projects/{project}/locations/{location}.
}

## Common Operations

### Creating Multiple Resources

```kcl
import gcp

provider = gcp.GcpProvider {
    project = "my-project-id"
}

# Create multiple execution resources
execution_0 = provider.workloadmanager_api.Execution {
    name = "value-0"
}
execution_1 = provider.workloadmanager_api.Execution {
    name = "value-1"
}
execution_2 = provider.workloadmanager_api.Execution {
    name = "value-2"
}
```

### Conditional Creation

```kcl
# Only create in production
if environment == "production":
    execution = provider.workloadmanager_api.Execution {
        name = "production-value"
    }
```
