//! Finalized_deal resource

//! Resumes serving of the given finalized deal. Calling this method for an running deal has no effect. If a deal is initially paused by the seller, calling this method will not resume serving of the deal until the seller also resumes the deal. This method only applies to programmatic guaranteed deals and preferred deals.
