//! Homepage resource
//!
//! Claims a store's homepage. Executing this method requires admin access. If the homepage is already claimed, this will recheck the verification (unless the business is exempted from claiming, which also exempts from verification) and return a successful response. If ownership can no longer be verified, it will return an error, but it won't clear the claim. In case of failure, a canonical error message is returned: * PERMISSION_DENIED: User doesn't have the necessary permissions on this Merchant Center account. * FAILED_PRECONDITION: - The account is not a Merchant Center account. - Merchant Center account doesn't have a homepage. - Claiming failed (in this case the error message contains more details).
