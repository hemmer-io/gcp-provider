//! Service resource
//!
//! Creates a new managed service. A managed service is immutable, and is subject to mandatory 30-day data retention. You cannot move a service or recreate it within 30 days after deletion. One producer project can own no more than 500 services. For security and reliability purposes, a production service should be hosted in a dedicated producer project. Operation
