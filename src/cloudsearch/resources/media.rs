//! Media resource
//!
//! Uploads media for indexing. The upload endpoint supports direct and resumable upload protocols and is intended for large items that can not be [inlined during index requests](https://developers.google.com/cloud-search/docs/reference/rest/v1/indexing.datasources.items#itemcontent). To index large content: 1. Call indexing.datasources.items.upload with the item name to begin an upload session and retrieve the UploadItemRef. 1. Call media.upload to upload the content, as a streaming request, using the same resource name from the UploadItemRef from step 1. 1. Call indexing.datasources.items.index to index the item. Populate the [ItemContent](/cloud-search/docs/reference/rest/v1/indexing.datasources.items#ItemContent) with the UploadItemRef from step 1. For additional information, see [Create a content connector using the REST API](https://developers.google.com/cloud-search/docs/guides/content-connector#rest). **Note:** This API requires a service account to execute.
