//! Global_operation resource
//!
//! Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE`
or for the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the
specified Operation resource. This method differs from the
`GET` method in that it waits for no more than the default
deadline (2 minutes) and then returns the current state of the operation,
which might be `DONE` or still in progress.

This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically:
   
   
    - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might
    return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero
    seconds.
   - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the
    operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry
    if the operation is not `DONE`.
