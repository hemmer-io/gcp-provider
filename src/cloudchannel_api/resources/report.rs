//! Report resource
//!
//! Begins generation of data for a given report. The report identifier is a UID (for example, `613bf59q`). Possible error codes: * PERMISSION_DENIED: The user doesn't have access to this report. * INVALID_ARGUMENT: Required request parameters are missing or invalid. * NOT_FOUND: The report identifier was not found. * INTERNAL: Any non-user error related to a technical issue in the backend. Contact Cloud Channel support. * UNKNOWN: Any non-user error related to a technical issue in the backend. Contact Cloud Channel support. Return value: The ID of a long-running operation. To get the results of the operation, call the GetOperation method of CloudChannelOperationsService. The Operation metadata contains an instance of OperationMetadata. To get the results of report generation, call CloudChannelReportsService.FetchReportResults with the RunReportJobResponse.report_job. Deprecated: Please use [Export Channel Services data to BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/channel/docs/rebilling/export-data-to-bigquery) instead.
