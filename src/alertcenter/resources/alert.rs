//! Alert resource
//!
//! Restores, or "undeletes", an alert that was marked for deletion within the past 30 days. Attempting to undelete an alert which was marked for deletion over 30 days ago (which has been removed from the Alert Center database) or a nonexistent alert returns a `NOT_FOUND` error. Attempting to undelete an alert which has not been marked for deletion has no effect.
