//! Available_location resource
//!
//! **DECOMMISSIONED.** **If called, this endpoint will return a 404 error.** _Instead, use the applicable resource-specific REST API (or associated documentation, as needed) to determine valid locations for each resource used in your Project._ Lists the valid ["locations for default Google Cloud resources"](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations#default-cloud-location) for the specified Project (including a FirebaseProject). One of these locations can be selected as the Project's location for default Google Cloud resources, which is the geographical location where the Project's resources associated with Google App Engine (such as the default Cloud Firestore instance) will be provisioned by default. However, if the location for default Google Cloud resources has already been set for the Project, then this setting cannot be changed. This call checks for any possible [location restrictions](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/defining-locations) for the specified Project and, thus, might return a subset of all possible locations. To list all locations (regardless of any restrictions), call the endpoint without specifying a unique project identifier (that is, `/v1beta1/{parent=projects/-}/listAvailableLocations`). To call `ListAvailableLocations` with a specified project, a member must be at minimum a Viewer of the Project. Calls without a specified project do not require any specific project permissions.
