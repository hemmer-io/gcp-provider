//! Retrieve a list of links connected to a specific asset. Links represent the data flow between **source** (upstream) and **target** (downstream) assets in transformation pipelines. Links are stored in the same project as the Lineage Events that create them. You can retrieve links in every project where you have the `datalineage.events.get` permission. The project provided in the URL is used for Billing and Quota.
