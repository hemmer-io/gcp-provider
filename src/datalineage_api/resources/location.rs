//! Location resource

//! Retrieve information about LineageProcesses associated with specific links. LineageProcesses are transformation pipelines that result in data flowing from **source** to **target** assets. Links between assets represent this operation. If you have specific link names, you can use this method to verify which LineageProcesses contribute to creating those links. See the SearchLinks method for more information on how to retrieve link name. You can retrieve the LineageProcess information in every project where you have the `datalineage.events.get` permission. The project provided in the URL is used for Billing and Quota.
