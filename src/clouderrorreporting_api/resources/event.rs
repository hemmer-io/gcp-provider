//! Event resource
//!
//! Report an individual error event and record the event to a log. This endpoint accepts **either** an OAuth token, **or** an [API key](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158862) for authentication. To use an API key, append it to the URL as the value of a `key` parameter. For example: `POST https://clouderrorreporting.googleapis.com/v1beta1/{projectName}/events:report?key=123ABC456` **Note:** [Error Reporting] (https://cloud.google.com/error-reporting) is a service built on Cloud Logging and can analyze log entries when all of the following are true: * Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) are disabled on the log bucket. * The log bucket satisfies one of the following: * The log bucket is stored in the same project where the logs originated. * The logs were routed to a project, and then that project stored those logs in a log bucket that it owns.
