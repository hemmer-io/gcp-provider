//! Deployment resource
//!
//! Generates a report for a dry run analysis of an UndeployApiProxy request without committing the undeploy. In addition to the standard validations performed when removing deployments, additional analysis will be done to detect possible traffic routing changes that would result from this deployment being removed. Any potential routing conflicts or unsafe changes will be reported in the response. This routing analysis is not performed for a non-dry-run UndeployApiProxy request. For a request path `organizations/{org}/environments/{env}/apis/{api}/revisions/{rev}/deployments:generateUndeployChangeReport`, two permissions are required: * `apigee.deployments.delete` on the resource `organizations/{org}/environments/{env}` * `apigee.proxyrevisions.undeploy` on the resource `organizations/{org}/apis/{api}/revisions/{rev}`
