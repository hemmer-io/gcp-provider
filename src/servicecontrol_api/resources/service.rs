//! Service resource
//!
//! This method provides telemetry reporting for services that are integrated with [Service Infrastructure](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure). It reports a list of operations that have occurred on a service. It must be called after the operations have been executed. For more information, see [Telemetry Reporting](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/telemetry-reporting). NOTE: The telemetry reporting has a hard limit of 100 operations and 1MB per Report call. This method requires the `servicemanagement.services.report` permission on the specified service. For more information, see [Service Control API Access Control](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-control/access-control).
