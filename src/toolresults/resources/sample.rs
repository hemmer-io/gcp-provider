//! Sample resource
//!
//! Creates a batch of PerfSamples - a client can submit multiple batches of Perf Samples through repeated calls to this method in order to split up a large request payload - duplicates and existing timestamp entries will be ignored. - the batch operation may partially succeed - the set of elements successfully inserted is returned in the response (omits items which already existed in the database). May return any of the following canonical error codes: - NOT_FOUND - The containing PerfSampleSeries does not exist
