//! Member resource
//!
//! Creates a membership for the calling Chat app, a user, or a Google Group. Creating memberships for other Chat apps isn't supported. When creating a membership, if the specified member has their auto-accept policy turned off, then they're invited, and must accept the space invitation before joining. Otherwise, creating a membership adds the member directly to the specified space. Supports the following types of [authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize): - [App authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app) with [administrator approval](https://support.google.com/a?p=chat-app-auth) and the authorization scope: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.app.memberships` - [User authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) with one of the following authorization scopes: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.memberships` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.memberships.app` (to add the calling app to the space) - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.import` (import mode spaces only) - User authentication grants administrator privileges when an administrator account authenticates, `use_admin_access` is `true`, and the following authorization scope is used: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.admin.memberships` App authentication is not supported for the following use cases: - Inviting users external to the Workspace organization that owns the space. - Adding a Google Group to a space. - Adding a Chat app to a space. For example usage, see: - [Invite or add a user to a space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-members#create-user-membership). - [Invite or add a Google Group to a space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-members#create-group-membership). - [Add the Chat app to a space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-members#create-membership-calling-api).
