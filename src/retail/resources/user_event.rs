//! User_event resource
//!
//! Starts a user-event rejoin operation with latest product catalog. Events are not annotated with detailed product information for products that are missing from the catalog when the user event is ingested. These events are stored as unjoined events with limited usage on training and serving. You can use this method to start a join operation on specified events with the latest version of product catalog. You can also use this method to correct events joined with the wrong product catalog. A rejoin operation can take hours or days to complete.
